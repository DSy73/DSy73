## About

Founder with over 26 years of professional experience in banking and information technologies, including 23 years within Türkiye İş Bankası, spanning mission-critical systems, legacy platforms, and enterprise-scale transformation initiatives.

I am the Founder and Lead Architect of **Mentrova**, an AI-driven platform addressing knowledge continuity and talent allocation challenges in legacy-system-dependent industries, particularly finance. Mentrova applies predictive insight models and AI-supported matching to transform scarce human expertise into actionable institutional intelligence.

This GitHub profile includes selected **reference implementations** and applied projects that demonstrate my hands-on approach to software architecture, secure system design, and end-to-end product development. These projects are shared to illustrate technical capability and execution style.

The core Mentrova platform is developed separately and is not publicly available due to intellectual property considerations and ongoing pilot work.

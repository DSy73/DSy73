## About

I am a technology leader with over 23 years of experience in banking and information technologies, focusing on the design and delivery of mission-critical systems in highly regulated environments.

I am the Founder and Lead Architect of **Mentrova**, an AI-driven platform addressing knowledge continuity and talent allocation challenges in legacy-system-dependent industries, particularly finance. Mentrova applies predictive insight models and AI-supported matching to transform scarce human expertise into actionable institutional intelligence.

This GitHub profile includes selected **reference implementations** and applied projects that demonstrate my hands-on approach to software architecture, secure system design, and end-to-end product development. These projects are shared to illustrate technical capability and execution style.

The core Mentrova platform is developed separately and is not publicly available due to intellectual property considerations and ongoing pilot work.
